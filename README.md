# My 2018 Election Forecast

Here is my forecase for the 2018 congressional election: 

Having learned their lesson from the 2016 election, pollsters will factor in the turnout of the Trump voter base, and this time around, will be able to fairly accurately call the outcome of the election. In particular, the Democrats will reap the benefits of a young voter base angry about Trump, and will gain about 35 seats in the House to take control. However, in the Senate, the blue wave won’t be strong enough for the Dems to overcome the enormously unfavorable map and the Republicans will keep the Senate, 52-48. 

Four races to note:

* FL Senate: Bush v. Gore 2.0. Scott will lead, but Broward County will be nothing but trouble with a record amount of mail-in votes. 
* ME-2: the new ranked choice system will leave voters without fear of vote splitting; the race will be snatched from Poliquin as Golden’s centrist appeal will draw more second choice votes
* AZ Senate: 80% of the state votes mail-in which means late results rolling in. Sinema will squeeze by with a win
* Big name Dems are in trouble: Beto, Abrams, and Gillum will all lose. Too much hype, not enough support.
